# ValheimEndgame
A heavily modded Valheim repo for Clients and Servers. Rediscover Valheim and embark on a new adventure!

## For the best experience we recommend:
- Launch Options: -window-mode exclusive -screen-fullscreen
- Add "gfx-enable-jobs=1" and "gfx-enable-native-gfx-jobs=1" in valheim_Data\boot.config
- Do NOT use vulcan api
- HD Texture Pack: https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/302
- And an updated Version of a Networking Mod to fix desyncs

## To suit your taste
Have a lot of trolls on the server and want to save your own items:
- Valheim\BepInEx\config\valheim_plus.cfg
   - Disable Ward section

Feel like it's too hard:
- ValheimClient\BepInEx\config\org.bepinex.plugins.creaturelevelcontrol.cfg
   - Adjust Difficulty and/or DMG and HP per Star

## To-Do List:
- Fix Desyncs
- Optimize Valheim Legends balancing
- Add Backpacks to the Loottable
- Optimize Boss difficulty
- Serpent isn't scary enough
   - Either boats get oneshot or they are indestructable...
- Add another Endgame difficulty spike
   - Equipment is there, just need to add more stars

## Known Issues:
- In rare instances dying seems to decrease performance and spams an error that is being investigated
